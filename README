# Brian Wang (Co-founder of Fitocracy.com) finally replied
..  to my question regqrding public or private API access and documentation.
As it seems he does not want us to develop an Android client.

**‏@Walialu:**
seems to me as #fitocracy don't want us to release a native android app. at least they ignore my request regarding api access. :(

**@brianmwang:**
@Walialu Email me at brian at fitocracy dot com

**@Walialu:**
@brianmwang What was this exactly meant for? I mean, I emailed you, but you did not reply.. not even with a simple "no" :(

**@brianmwang:**
@Walialu I hadn't slept for nearly 2 days, relax! I'll get back to you but this week is crazy

**@brianmwang:**
@Walialu sorry, public API won’t be avail for a while. It’s planned but there are tons of other priorities right now.

**@Walialu:**
@brianmwang I don't mind using your private API as I did before. I guess the private API is well documented.

**@Walialu:**
@brianmwang but I don't want to sniff all requests by myself and write down how to use it and what it does. ;-)

**@brianmwang:**
@Walialu Sorry, no plans to make private API available to 3rd parties at this moment.
